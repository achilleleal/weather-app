# Weather App 🌧️
This app was made using React and TailwindCSS for the frontend, and Express for the backend. The weather data is fetched from the OpenWeatherMap.  
  
The frontend sends a post request, with the city name inside the body, to the server. 
The server then fetches the weather of said city from OpenWeatherMap, and sends it to the frontend to display the data.
